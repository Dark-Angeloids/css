            <h1>My Portofolio</h1>
            <p>Yu-Gi-Oh!, known in Japan as <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters</strong>, is a Japanese anime series <br> animated by
                Studio Gallop based on the <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> manga series written by Kazuki Takahashi. <br> It is
                the second anime adaptation of the manga following the 1998 anime television series <br> produced by Toei Animation.
                The
                series revolves around a young high school boy named <br> <em>Yugi Muto</em> who battles opponents in the Duel
                Monsters card game. The
                series begins from <br> chapter 60 in volume 7 before loosely adapting the remaining chapters of the original manga
                <br> by making
                story changes that conflict with the events of the manga canon.
            
                <strong>Yu-Gi-Oh!</strong> originally <br> aired in Japan on TV Tokyo from April 2000 to September 2004, running for
                224 episodes; <br> A
                remastered version, highlighting certain duels, began airing in Japan in February 2015.

                <h2>Passion 1</h2>
                <p>Long ago, when the pyramids were still young, Egyptian kings played a game of great and terrible power. These Shadow
                Games erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the entire world – until a brave and resourceful Pharaoh locked the
                magic away, imprisoning it within the mystical Millennium Items.
                
                Centuries later, a boy named Yugi Muto unlocks the secret of the Millennium Puzzle. Infused with ancient magical
                energies, he summons forth the spirit of the Pharaoh from eons ago, for destiny has chosen him to defend the world from
                the return of the Shadow Games.</p>

            <div class="grid-box box-third">  
                <h2>Passion 2</h2>
                <p>Teamed with an eclectic group of loyal friends against an extraordinary array of formidable foes, Yugi and the Pharaoh
                together battle to defeat forces of unimaginable evil. They ultimately succeed and prevent the world from plunging into
                darkness forever.
                
                With their mission complete, Yugi and the Pharaoh hold one final match against each other to determine whether Yugi is
                capable of standing alone without the Pharaoh’s help. When the ritual duel of destiny ends with the Pharaoh’s defeat,
                the magical Millennium Items are buried deep beneath the Egyptian sands and the Pharaoh’s soul returns to whence it
                came. </p>

                <h2>Passion 3</h2> 
                <p>And thus the story came to an end. Until now.
                
                The stakes have never been higher; the rivalries never as fierce; the risks never so great. One wrong move—one card
                short—and it’s game over for good. A decade in the making, Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions features new designs
                and an all-new story from the original creator of the global phenomenon, Kazuki Takahashi. His masterful tale features
                anime’s most beloved characters in their long-awaited return: Yugi Muto, Seto Kaiba, and their faithful friends Joey
                Wheeler, Tristan Taylor Téa Gardner, and Bakura. It’s the most highly anticipated re-YU-nion ever!</p>

                <p>The end of Dark Side of Dimensions is when Kaiba begins to see Yugi as a friend. They don’t actually have a lot of
                interaction before this, because it is mostly Yami and Seto working together. Besides, Seto’s personality is a bit
                intense for Yugi, who is usually timid and shy. Before, Seto had been fixated only on the Pharaoh and seemed to think
                that everything Yugi had before was because of Atem. Seto seemed to think that all of Yugi’s exceptional qualities, his
                spirit, skill, and strength came from Yami. However, after seeing Yugi stand up for his friends by himself in Dark Side
                of Dimensions, Seto began to respect Yugi and realize that Yugi could be strong on his own and that he was a worthy
                opponent. Seto even saves Yugi in their team-up duel against Diva so that Yugi and the Pharoh can save the day. Seto is
                generally a controlling person who prefers to rely on his own abilities rather than on others, so this shows the level
                of trust that Seto places in Yugi. Yugi gains Seto’s respect and Seto is much friendlier to Yugi after the battle
                against Diva. Dark Side of Dimensions is basically the story of how Yugi and Seto became friends.</p>

                <p>The last references to this in the anime are during the final Duel, when Téa wishes Atem to be victorious so she does not have to say goodbye to him, but also roots for Yugi 
                    without even realizing it. She also does have friendly feelings toward the original Yugi as it is shown in many episodes when Rebecca Hawkins hugs Yugi, Téa appears upset;
                     though this is before she accepts that Yugi and Yami are two alter egos with separate personalities. Téa has also hugged Yugi on two occasions during the second series anime 
                     - Once during the Virtual World Arc, after she beats Crump in a Duel after being nearly encased in ice and Yugi comes to her aid, and again during the Waking the Dragons Arc after Yami Yugi
                      defeats Dartz, and Yugi's soul is returned to his body, along with Kaiba's and Joey's. Both of these cases occur during anime-only arcs in the story as neither the Virtual World arc or 
                      the Waking the Dragons arc are present in the manga. However towards the end of the fifth season though she is still seen unable to decide for her affections greatly reside in either Yugi Muto 
                      or Yami Yugi, however after the Ceremonial Duel and Atem walks through the Gates of the afterlife she is seen trying to run after him however stopped by Joey. 
                    She does really care about Yami and has genuine and intense romantic affection for him too.</p>

                <h3>Hi, I'm Yami Yugi!</h3>
                <p>
                Yami Yugi, known as Dark Yugi in the manga and Japanese versions, and also referred to as the Nameless Pharaoh,<br> is the spirit of Pharaoh Atem that has been sealed in the Millennium Puzzle. He is the main protagonist of the original and second <br> series, along with Yugi Muto.
Together with Yugi he holds the title "King of Games" (King of Duelists in Japanese version), <br> by winning in the Duelist Kingdom, Battle City, Grand Championship and Battle City V2 (in GX anime) tournaments. <br>
After Yugi Muto solved the Millennium Puzzle, Yami Yugi resided in Yugi's body and would take possession <br> of it when Yugi or his friends were in danger. After Yugi became fully aware of Yami's existence, <br> Yugi could voluntarily give control of his body to the Pharaoh; occasionally before one would give control to the other, <br> they would, as souls in the mind of the one controlling Yugi's body, converse with each other, usually about their options of what to do when in difficult situations.
